# HospitalManagmentSystem
in this small system with nextjs, I used redux, nextjs and elementui library, the project is not compeleted, displayed main functionalities required which are fetching data(from json in this case), listing data, navigation in nextjs, searching for a patient, and styling.
the two pages that are working are home page and group page which is patients page.
search bar will submit when it's blured, and will show the searched item in the patients page.
Auth system was not implemented as currently there is no backend.
